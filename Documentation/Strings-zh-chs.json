You can disable the camera at the firmware-layer, so it doesn't matter what the end user does. Reinstalling the OS or wiping the computer won't turn the camera back on.

For example, you want to upgrade your Windows 10/11 Professional devices to Windows 10/11 Enterprise. Or, you want the device to switch out of S mode. Windows 10/11 S mode is designed for security and performance. You can use Intune to switch out of S mode. Switching out of S mode is one way. And once you switch out of S mode, you can't go back to Windows 10/11 S mode. This feature applies to: Windows 10 and later, Windows 10 1809 or later for S mode and Windows Holographic for Business. These features are available in Intune, and are configurable by the administrator. Intune uses configuration profiles to create and customize these settings for your organization's needs. After you add these features in a profile, you can then push or deploy the profile to devices running Windows 10 or later in your organization. When you deploy the profile, Intune automatically upgrades the devices or switches out of S mode.",
